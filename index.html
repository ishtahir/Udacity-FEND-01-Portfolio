            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ish Tahir and I'm 31 years old. I was born in Queens, NYC and moved to Austin, Texas when I was 13 years old. I am the oldest of four children and I have three younger sisters.</p>

            <p>I started playing around with HTML when I was about 13 years old but never thought to make it a career. When the first iPhone came out, I fell in love. From then on I knew I wanted to become an iOS developer. After years of trying to self teach myself Objective-C and failing consistently, I decided to go back to school for Computer Science.</p>

            <p>I am halfway done with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and things couldn't be any better. Last year, due to some management changes at my day job, I decided to look for an exit strategy to pursue my dreams of being in the Computer Science field. On top of going to College, I was self teaching myself Swift so I can get a head start on my iOS career, but kept falling into the same problem of getting stuck and not finding a good answer to why I was getting stuck.</p>

            <p>In December 2017 I was looking to switch to cyber security. My cousin works in cyber security and is doing very well for himself. I was asking for his advice in how to get started and he told me that I had 3 options, I could stay in app development, do cyber security, or web developement. I had already failed at app development for the better part of 6 years, and I knew nothing about cyber security. I thought about it for a quick second and the decision was clear, I wanted to do web development. I already had experience with it, it was just time to refresh my skills and build upon it. My cousin told me about Udacity's Nanodegree Scholarships and I applied that day. I was thrilled when I got accepted into the first part of the scholarship.</p>

            <p>The first part was a 3 month program with HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics. I finished that within 2 weeks and kept pursuing other resources such as Treehouse to continue my web development journey, while staying busy with College and my day job. I didn't get the scholarship for the Nanodegree but that would have just been a bonus because I was planning to take the Front End Nanodegree regardless. I am super glad to be here and I can't wait to see what I achieve.</p>
